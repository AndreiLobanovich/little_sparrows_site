        text: 'We stayed in Belgrade years longer than planned, because nowhere did a preschool come anywhere close to this superb kindergarten. We saw our children thrive and learn so much! Let\'s start with what your child gets here: cooked healthy warm meals by their resident cooking staff, sold-out overnight pajama parties, your kid will have native fluency in Russian or English, swim classes by nationally ranked athletes, pottery classes starting from a young age, music lessons, ballet, karate, outdoor time. You can tell that the teachers are hand-selected and dedicated.',

        text: 'Little Sparrows not only offers a family-like environment but also keeps professionalism at a very high level while promoting the independence of the children. The long working hours allow both parents lots of flexibility. The huge variety of activities during kindergarten time allows us to spend extra quality time with our child. Another huge plus is that we can choose between Russian and English classes, with the possibility of additional German or Chinese classes. Most of the staff are native speakers, something that you can’t easily find. They are very attentive and responsive, our little one loves going there and we love it too!',
